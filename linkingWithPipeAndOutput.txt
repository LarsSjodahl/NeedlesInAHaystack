Use the CheatSheet_chaining_and_utils.txt for reference.
This part of the "adventure" does not contain (require) any regex, just how to combine utils together.

Try using combinations of cat, head and tail on one of the test file.

Try for instance
head test.txt
cat test.txt | head
head -n30 test.txt
head -n30 test.txt | tail -n5
cat test.txt | sort | head -n15


piping with grep:
try finding the dates, URLs, GUIDs or Ip-addresses in test-files using
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort 
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq 
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq -c 
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq -c | sort
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n        
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
grep '<relevant pattern>' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nrk 1
